Section 5. CIVIL COURTS\u2019 JURISDICTION IN REVENUE MATTERS BARRED.. The Civil Courts have no right to issue an injunction in respect of revenue matters because there is an inherent lack of jurisdiction.1. The Supreme Court has laid down:. No doubt if the suit is one properly entertainable by the Civil Court the period of limitation must be governed by the provisions of the Limitation Act and no other. But if one reads section 209 and 331 of the U. P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms-Act (I of 1951) together one finds that a suit like the instant one has to be filed before a special court created under the Act within a period of limitation specially prescribed under the Rules made under the Act and the jurisdiction of the ordinary Civil Court is absolutely barred.2. SUB-SECTION (2) \u2014 APPLICATION OF THE PROVISION TO DELHI HIGH COURT\u2019S ORIGINAL JURISDICTION.. Under the Delhi High Court Act, 1966, a suit valuing more than fifty thousand rupees is triable by the High Court in its original side. As such the Delhi High Court having ordinary original civil jurisdiction in respect of Union Territory of Delhi is competent to try such suit, taking it as a suit of civil nature.3. IMPORTANCE OF THE SECTION \u2014 APPLICATION OF THE CODE TO REVENUE COURTS \u2014 PROVISIONS OF SECTION 104 DO NOT SEEK, LIMIT OR AFFECT THE PROVISIONS OF LETTERS PATENT.. The importance of this section is that wherever the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure are sought to be excluded by any special enactment which may be silent on the point, the State Government can by notification apply the provisions of Revenue Courts. All other civil courts would normally be governed by the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure in the matter of procedure. Section 4(1) of the Code which is a saving provision clearly provides that in the absence of any specific provision to the contrary the provisions of the Code do not limit or affect any special or local law. . Thus the test contained in Section 4 is not applicable in the instant case because even if the Letters Patent of the High Court be deemed to be special law as contemplated by Section 4 the provisions of Section 104 do not seek to limit or affect the provisions of the Letters Patent.4. APPLICATION OF THE CODE TO REVENUE COURTS \u2014 JURISDICTION OF ORDINARY CIVIL COURT WHEN BARRED.. The Supreme Court had laid down:. No doubt if the suit is one properly entertainable by the Civil Court the period of limitation must be governed by the provisions of the Limitation Act and no other. But if one reads section 209 and 331 of the U. P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act (I of 1951) together one finds that a suit like the instant one has to be filed before a special court created under the Act within a period of limitation specially prescribed under the Rules made under the Act and the jurisdiction of the ordinary Civil Court is absolutely barred.5. 1.

That in the said suit the Appellant had moved Misc. Application No\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 under section 41, read with Second Schedule of the Arbitration Act, asking for issue of a temporary injunction restraining the appellant from encashing the bank guarantee.. 3. That the application was decided by Hon\u2019ble\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. J. of this Court, who held that it was well settled that the performance guarantee, even though having its genesis in the primary contract between the parties, is nevertheless autonomous and independent contract;. That a Bank which gives a performance guarantee must honour the guarantee according to its terms and that it is not concerned in the least with the relations between the supplier and the customer, nor with- questions of performing the obligations by the parties. The guarantee was bound to be absolute and the application was accordingly dismissed.. 4. That against the order of dismissal, the appellant filed the present Letters Patent Appeal, which has been admitted by this Hon\u2019ble Court on\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. 1984, and ad interim injunction has been granted to the appellant.. 5.

That the right vis a vis filing of an appeal in the context of the law which is attracted, would crystallise on the date on which the matter was originally instituted and a later amendment may not adversely affect the right of the respondent, and as such section 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure is attracted and the orders of interim injunction as well as admitting the appeal are beyond the jurisdiction of this Hon\u2019ble Court, the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure not being applicable to matter.. 7.

APPLICATION OF THE RULE\u2014ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE\u2014WHEN TO BE ADMITTED.. The discretion to receive and admit additional evidence is not an arbitrary one, but is a judicial one circumscribed by the limitation specified in O. 41, Rule 27, Civil P. C. If the additional evidence was allowed to be adduced contrary to the principles governing the reception of such evidence, it would be a case of improper exercise of discretion, and the additional evidence so brought on the record will have. to he ignored and the case decided as it was non-existent. Under O. 41, Rule 27, it is the appellate court that must require the evidence to enable it to pronounce judgment. As laid down by the Privy Council in the well-known case1.. \u201cThe legitimate occasion for the application of the present rule is, when on examining the evidence, as it stands, some inherent lacuna or defect becomes apparent, not where a discovery is made, outside the court, of fresh evidence and application is made to import it. \u201d And they reiterated this view in stronger terms even in the later case2. The true test, therefore, is whether the appellate court is able to pronounce judgment on the materials before it without taking into consideration the additional evidence sought to be adduced3.. ADMISSION OF ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE\u2014WHEN CAN BE REFUSED? (MANY YEARS AFTER FILING SUIT).. Before the High Court, Pramod Kumari filed an application for reception of additional evidence. The principal additional evidence sought to be adduced was an alleged letter said to have been written by late Pearey Lal Singh to the bank nominating Pramod Kumari as the person entitled to the amount in deposit with the bank. The letter itself was not filed along with the application but a request was made to summon the letter from the bank. The High Court rejected the application. . The application to the High Court was made very many years after the suit had been filed, and also quite some years after the appeal had been filed before the High Court, and we do not think that we will be justified in interfering with the discretion exercised by the High Court in refusing to receive additional evidence at that stage. The appeal is therefore dismissed but in the circumstances with no order as to costs4.. POWER OF HIGH COURT UNDER SECTION 115 CPC. Order 41, Rule 27, Section 15. The High Court in exercise of its power under Section 115, CPC, could not interfere with an order of appellate Court rejecting permission to adduce additional evidence particularly when the whole appeal is not before the High Court.5. ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE. Order 41, Rule 27. Section 107, CPC enables an appellate Court to take additional evidence or to require such other evidence to be taken subject to such conditions and limitations as are prescribed under Order XII, Rule 27, CPC.5. 1.

That the aforesaid is commercial property and when it is given on rent, is going to fetch more than Rs\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 per year.. 3. That the defendants have no property of their own within the jurisdiction of this Hon\u2019ble Court.. 4. That in the circumstances it is therefore expedient in the ends of justice that a receiver be appointed by the Court to take possession of the suit property and to realise the rent and deposit the same in this Hon\u2019ble Court..

APPOINTMENT OF RESPONDENT AS RECEIVER\u2014PETITIONER\u2019S COUNTER CLAIM REJECTED\u2014PROPRIETY OF.. The receiver was appointed for managing Colliery pit in dispute. He was authorised to appoint an agent for working the pit in question. One or the other of the parties was to be appointed as the agent undisputably. The respondent accepted. the offer made by the receiver. Thereafter the petitioner also expressed his willingness to accept the offer but by way of a counter offer raising the minimum guarantee. After consulting the Advocate General of West Bengal, the Receiver held that there was a concluded contract between him and the respondent, and he appointed the respondent as his agent to work pit I.. That from the facts set out, it is absolutely clear that the receiver had acted in the most proper manner. There is no basis for the allegation made by the petitioner that he had been coerced to appoint the respondent as his agent. The fact that at one stage the respondent had filed an application to the Supreme Court to remove the receiver can in no manner be said to have influenced the decision of the receiver to appoint the respondent as his agent. There were no grounds to think that the receiver had acted either improperly or under coercion1.. APPOINTMENT OF RECEIVER \u2014 ACT DONE IS SUBJECT TO DIRECTIONS AND ORDERS OF COURT.. Any act of the Receiver done on behalf of the court pendente. lite and anyone who gets possession through such an act could only do so subject to the directions and Orders of the Court. The tenancy created in favour of \u201cT\u201d by the Receiver is in violation and contrary to the injunction order and such an act is subject to the direction and order of the Court appointing the Receiver. Therefore, the tenancy created in favour of \u201cT\u201d was in breach of the order of the Court and consequently \u201cT\u201d cannot claim any protection under the provisions of the Act and they are liable to be evicted2.. APPLICATION FOR APPOINTMENT OF RECEIVER\u2014DEFAULT IN PAYMENT OF INSTALMENT TO FINANCIAL CORPORATION-MILL OWNER WILLING TO DEPOSIT INSTALMENT \u2014 ORDER SET ASIDE.. An affidavit has been filed by the appellant that the amount of Corporation has been paid. The only amount that remains due is penal interest but its waiver is under consideration of the corporation.. In the circumstances there is no merit in the submission of the learned counsel for the respondent that the order of the High Court directing handing over of the mill to receiver should not be interfered. The running of the Mill, in the circumstances of this case by the family member, subject to the decision of the suit, shall be just and proper. Moreover the High Court had vacated its order because of the default in payment of instalment to the Corporation. Since that has been complied with we do not think it would be in interest of justice to maintain the order of High Court3.. JOINT FAMILY PROPERTY\u2014KARTA OF HUF DISPOSING OF SOME PROPERTY IN CONTRAVENTION OF COURT ORDER-APPLICATION FOR APPOINTMENT OF RECEIVER\u2014SUPREME COURT APPOINTING ADMINISTRATOR WITH POWERS AND DUTIES OF RECEIVER.. Allowing the appeal it was held that it was just and convenient in order to effectively prevent any of the suit properties being dissipated or disposed of and in order to preserve the same that the suit properties should be placed under the management and control of a person other than Karta. The court appointed Administrator in respect of the properties having the same powers and duties of Receiver4.. Order 40 Rule 1. APPOINTMENT OF RECEIVER ON DISSOLUTION OF FIRM. A receiver is to be appointed as a matter of course when a partnership is dissolved under orders of Court or if a partnership is already dissolved any of the parties come to Court for relief due to him as an ex-partner5.. WHEN RECEIVER CAN BE APPOINTED. The Court should appoint a receiver in a mortgage suit as in a suit of any other nature when it is just and convenient6.. STAGES FOR APPOINTMENT OF RECEIVER.. The Court has power to appoint a receiver whenever it appears to be just and convenient whether before or after the decree. The jurisdiction to appoint a receiver is not restricted by any words contained in the decree7.. THIRD PARTY RECEIVER \u2014 WHEN MAY BE APPOINTED \u2014 CONSIDERATIONS FOR.. In a case which arises under this Rule, the primary thing which has to be looked into by a court before the wishes of the parties are acceded to is to see how best the suit properties could be preserved without being wasted..  The responsibility in courts becomes all the more greater if there is a race as between the two competing parties to possess the suit properties. It is imperative for the courts to see that the suit properties over which such conflicting claims are projected, are not only preserved but are kept without being wasted or without any prejudice, being caused to any one of the parties to the litigation by any overt or covert act on the part of any party to it. . It is only to create a harmony and not to ferment disharmony that the intendment of this Rule should be perpetrated8.. WHEN APPOINTMENT OF THIRD PARTY AS RECEIVER NOT PROPER.. Where in a partition suit, the appellant is admittedly in possession of a house on an alleged plot of land and is living there with his family members, he had inducted tenants in the other houses and rooms on that plot and till late was realising rent from the said tenants and repairing those houses regularly, the Court below was not justified in appointing a third party as receiver of that plot of land during the pendency of the suit9.. REMAND TO TRIAL COURT FOR APPOINTMENT OF RECEIVER. As regards the appointment of receiver, where no orders were passed by the Trial Court and as such no appeal was competent, the lower appellate Court was of opinion that the suit shall not have been stayed under section 3 of the Arbitration Act, then the case should have been sent back to trial court for deciding the application for appointment of receiver.10. APPOINTING OF RECEIVER (ORDER 40 RULE 1). The power to appoint a Receiver suo motu, cannot be exercised by the High Court particularly when none of the parties has asked for it.11. REVIEW \u2014 SCOPE. Order 40 Rule 1. The power of review can be exercised for correction of a mistake and not to substitute a view. Such powers can be exercised within the limits of the statute dealing with the exercise of power. The review cannot be treated as an appeal in disguise.12. POWER TO APPOINT RECEIVER. The power to appoint a Receiver suo motu cannot be exercised in the manner in which it was exercised by the High Court.13. \u201cJUDGMENT\u201d \u2014 WHAT CONSTITUTES.

INTERLOCUTORY ORDERS \u2014 TRIAL COURT\u2019S ABSOLUTE JURISDICTION TO DECIDE THE MATTER\u2014OBSERVATIONS OF SUPERIOR COURT ONLY FOR A LIMITED PURPOSE.. It is now fairly well known that any observations made in the course of interlocutory proceedings are for limited purpose of those proceedings and the trial court is always free and in fact is expected to decide the matter uninfluenced by. any observations regarding appreciation of evidence etc., made by the revisional court for the limited purpose of those proceedings. The trial court will decide the matter in accordance with law in the light of its own assessment1.. PROVISO\u2014WHEN ORDER OF INJUNCTION IS ILLEGAL. Where temporary injunction is granted without notice to opposite party but reasons for court\u2019s opinion that delay would defeat the object of injunction if it were not given, the order of injunction is illegal2.. EX PARTE INJUNCTION TO PLAINTIFF PARTNERS RESTRAINING DEFENDANT PARTNERS WHEN CAN BE GRANTED.. While it is true that being partners the appellant\u2019s right to participate in the business of the plaintiff and to have access to the place of business and the account books cannot be denied, it is equally true that they cannot be permitted to carry hostile activities which may adversely affect the partnership business itself and may bring it to a stand still. . The trial court\u2019s step to prevent the appellants from interfering with the day to day management and working of the partnership, cannot be said that the formation of opinion by trial court to proceed in terms of Rule 3 and its proviso to pass an ex parte temporary injunction violates any of those provisions and calls for any interference3.. 1.

That the plaintiff has filed the accompanying suit for permanent injunction against the defendants which is pending disposal before this Hon\u2019ble Court.,. 2. That the plaintiff craves leave of this Hon\u2019ble Court and prays that the contents of the accompanying plaint/suit may kindly be read as part and parcel of this application as those are not being repeated herein for the sake of brevity.. 3. That the defendants particularly Nos. 1 and 2 are influential people who believe in taking the law in their own hands and also believe on using muscle powers.. 4. That the defendants Nos. 2 and 3 are bent upon grabbing the room and kitchen built by plaintiff with his own hard earned money and are threatening to forcibly evict the plaintiff and his family through collusion with goondas and of official machinery functioning.. 5.

Deponent.. case law. WHEN RELIEF TO BE GRANTED.. The relief should be awarded only in clear cases, reasonably free from doubt, and, when necessary, to prevent great and irreparable injury1.. BURDEN OF PROOF. Burden of proof rests upon the complainant to establish the material allegations entitling him to relief2.. POWER TO BE EXERCISED WITH EXTREME CAUTION.. To be applied in very clear cases \u2014 Guidelines for exercise of discretionary powers3.. CIRCUMSTANCES NOT COVERED BY ORDER 39 CPC \u2014 INHERENT JURISDICTION.. There being no such expression in Section 94 which expressly prohibits the issue of a temporary injunction in circumstances not covered by Order 39 or by any rules made under the Code, the Courts have inherent jurisdiction to issue temporary injunction in circumstances which are not covered by the provisions of Order 39, if the Court is of opinion that the interests of justice require the issue of such interim injunction4.. INJUNCTION WHEN ONLY AN INTERIM ORDER.. The matter ought to have been concluded by a final hearing as to whether temporary injunction will continue, if so on what terms until the disposal of the suit5.. OBSERVATIONS MADE IN INTERLOCUTORY PROCEEDINGS \u2014 FINAL ORDER.. The trial court in deciding the suit itself will not allow its mind to be affected in any manner by the observations which are made in the interlocutory proceedings. It should be clearly understood that at the final stage the suit is to be decided on the evidence which is led by the parties and any observations made during the proceedings in respect of the prayer for a temporary injunction whether made in the Courts below or by the High Court have no relevance whatsoever in passing the final verdict after the trial of the suit6.. REJOINDER TO THE REPLY BY THE DEFENDANT AGAINST TEMPORARY INJUNCTION.. The contingency of filing a rejoinder does not arise in every case, because it would arise only in such cases where some new plea or fact is introduced by the defendant in reply7.. INTERLOCUTORY ORDER IN THE COURSE OF A PROCEEDING WHEN WILL LAPSE.. With the final decision of the suit itself, unless of course the suit is one for permanent injunction and the interim injunction is made permanent as part of the decreed order by the Court8.. FINDING ARRIVED AT IN DEALING WITH TEMPORARY INJUNCTION.. The findings arrived at in dealing with applications for temporary injunction pending disposal of the suit, even if they relate to any material question involved in the suit cannot take the place of findings in the final decision of the suit9.. PRINCIPLES THAT GOVERN GRANT OR REFUSAL OF AN INTERIM INJUNCTION.. They depend upon a variety of circumstances. It is impossible to lay down, any rigid general rule on the subject by which the discretion of the Court ought in all cases be regulated.. It is true, that at the interlocutory stage, the court should not embark upon a detailed investigation on the relative merits of the contentions of the parties and it is enough if the plaintiff raises questions of a substantial character calling for decision after an examination of the facts and the law arising in the case.. The court should avoid expressing any opinion on the merits which would partake the character of a decision of the main issues in the case10.. JURISDICTION OF THE COURT TO ENTERTAIN THE SUIT.. It is incumbent upon the Court to determine that question as preliminary issue before making the order of injunction absolute11.. REJECTION OF PLAINT \u2014 TEMPORARY INJUNCTION ISSUED BY. TRIAL COURT DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY STAND REVIVED.. Orders granting temporary injunction do not aid and supplement the ultimate decision of the suits12.. CAUTION TO BE EXERCISED. (a) Fair prima facie case;. (b) Actual or threatened violation of the right;. (c) Productive or irreparable or atleast serious injury.. (d) Conduct;. (e) Acquiescence or delay;. (f) Greater convenience and. (g) No efficacious relief.. THE PHRASES \u201cPRIMA FACIE CASE\u201d, \u201cBALANCE OF CONVENIENCE\u201d AND \u201cIRREPARABLE LOSS\u201d.. Are not rhetoric phrases for incantation, but words of width and elasticity, to meet myriad situations, presented by mans ingenuity in given facts and circumstances, but always is hedged with sound exercise of judicial discretion to meet the ends of justice. It is very neigh impossible to find from facts prima facie case and balance of convenience. The respondent can be adequately compensated on their success13.. INGREDIENT TO BE ESTABLISHED TO OBTAIN AN INTERLOCUTORY INJUNCTION.. (i) In the event of withholding the relief of temporary injunction he will suffer an irreparable injury;. (ii) In the event of his success in the suit in establishing his alleged legal right encroachment whereof is \u201ccomplained against, he will not have the proper remedy in being awarded adequate damages.. (iii) The plaintiff must show a clear necessity for affording immediate protection to his legal right, if any and. (iv) Lastly the Court has to take into consideration the comparative mischief or inconvenience to the parties14.. TEMPORARY INJUNCTION UNDER SECTION 151 HAVING SAME IMPORT AS THAT OF THE ORDER PASSED UNDER ORDER 39 RULES 1 AND 2.. The appeal before the appellate court against such interim order was maintainable15.. APPELLATE COURT HAS ALL THE POWERS WHICH ARE VESTED IN THE TRIAL COURT.. But when the Court is considering the legality of the order of grant or refusal of temporary injunction in writ jurisdiction unless there is a fundamental wrong committed by the court below, it is not possible for the High Court to interfere with the orders of the court below which do not suffer from any error of law or infirmity.. EX PARTE AD INTERIM INJUNCTION \u2014 COURT DECLINING TO PASS ORDER \u2014 ORDER NOT APPEALABLE.. Where court is not satisfied that it should consider an application for temporary injunction under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 before notice to the Opposite party, it does not pass an order under these provisions, rather postpones the consideration of such application to a later date after notice to the opposite party and against such order no appeal lies16.. JURISDICTION OF APPELLATE COURT \u2014 INJUNCTION PETITION CANNOT BE DECIDED ON MERITS.. The powers is only to grant interim relief either in the nature of granting ad interim injunction or modify such an order for the purpose of preventing a possible injury or to preserve the subject matter of the suit for the time being. To enable the appellate court to consider the petition for injunction on merits for the first time will be virtually conferring jurisdiction on the appellate court which it otherwise does not have17.. CONCURRENT FINDING ON THE QUESTION OF BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE.. Courts having arrived at such conclusion did not commit any error of law or approach in that conclusion. No interference under revisional jurisdiction18.. GRANT OR REFUSAL OF TEMPORARY INJUNCTION RESTS ON SOUND EXERCISE OF DISCRETION.. It cannot be lightly interfered with unless it is shown that such exercise of discretion is unreasonable or capricious19.. COURT TO SCRUTINISE WHETHER THE APPLICATION FOR INJUNCTION IS UNDER ORDER 39 OR SECTION 151 OF THE CODE.. Where the court proceeded to discuss the requirements of prima facie case, balance of convenience and irreparable injury, inference will be justified that the Court acted under order 39 rather than under section 151 CPC. On the other hand, if the court observed that no injunction was justified under order 39 rules 1 and 2 but for the ends of justice, under the circumstances of the case, an order was passed then it would be reasonable to hold that the impugned order was passed under section 151 of the Code. This may be taken only as a guideline and not as a cut and dried formula20.. CONSIDERATIONS WHETHER AN INJUNCTION SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT ISSUE THREE REQUIREMENTS.. Whether an order of injunction should not issue on the facts of the case, the Court must also consider apart from prima facie case, the question of irreparable or serious injury and balance of convenience.. (a) Prima facie case21.. (b) Balance of convenience22.. (c) Irreparable loss and injury23. Order 39 Rules 1 & 2. BANK GUARANTEE \u2014 CONTRACT NOT VITIATED BY ANY FRAUD \u2014 NO IRRETRIEVABLE INJURY \u2014 INJUNCTION NOT TO BE GRANTED.. In law relating to bank guarantees, a party seeking injunction from encashing of bank guarantee by the suppliers has to show prima facie case of established fraud and an irretrievable injury. Irretrievable injury is of the nature as noticed in the case of Itek Corporation (566 Federal Supplement 1210), that is plaintiff has no adequate remedy in law and the allegations of irreparable harm are not speculative but genuine and immediate, the plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm if the requested relief is not granted.. Here there is no such problem. Once the plaintiff is able to establish fraud against the suppliers or suppliers-cum-lenders and obtains any decree for damages or diminution in price, there is no problem for affecting recoveries in a friendly country where the bankers and the suppliers are located. Nothing has been pointed out to show that the decree passed by the Indian Courts could not be executable in Sweden24.. PHRASES \u201cPRIMA FACIE CASE\u201d, \u201cBALANCE OF CONVENIENCE\u201d AND \u201cIRREPARABLE LOSS\u201d.. The phrases \u201cPrima Facie Case\u201d \u201cbalance of convenience\u201d and \u201cirreparable loss\u201d are not rhetoric phrases for incantation but words of width and elasticity, to meet myriad situations presented by man\u2019s ingenuity in given facts and circumstances, but always is hedged with sound exercise of judicial discretion to meet the ends of justice25.. Order 39 Rule 24.. WHETHER AGENT OF DEFENDANT CAN BE PROCEEDED AGAINST?\u2014 (YES).. The expression \u201cperson\u201d occurring in sub-rule (1) of the old provision of Rule 2, corresponding to Rule 2A of the Amended Code has been employed merely compendiously to designate every one in a group, defendant, his agent, servants and workmen and not for excluding any defendant against whom the order of injunction has primarily been pressed26.. Order 39 Rules 1 and 2. The injunction restraining transfer for property during pendency of the suit can be granted27.. It is now a settled position in law that an appeal lies against the order granting as well as refusing an injunction. There was a difference of opinion on this issue but now by catena of case law the position is settled that an appeal would lie not only against an order granting injunction but also against an order refusing the same as even that order could be described as an order passed under Order XXXIX, Rule 1 or 2 as the case may be.. Where an application for ex-parte injunction is made and the court refused to grant such an injunction and instead issues notice of the application to the opposite party. The order of refusal would be an order under Rule 1 or Rule 2 as the case may be and not under Rule 3 and hence it would be appealable under Order XLIII Rule l(r)28.. BREACH OF INJUNCTION ORDER. Order 39, Rule 2(A)(1). Where no order of injunction was passed against persons not impleaded in the suit they cannot be held guilty for breach of any order pased in such proceedings.29. ORDER IN CONTEMPT APPLICATION PASSED BY TRIAL COURT CANNOT BE KEPT IN ABEYANCE BY HIGH COURT WITHOUT DECIDING APPEAL ON MERITS.. Order 39, Rule 2A. Order passed by trial Court in contempt application under Order 39 Rule 2A CPC cannot be kept in abeyance by High Court in appeal without deciding appeal on merits.30. EX-PARTE INTERIM INJUNCTION. Order 39 Rule 3. If a Court which passed the order granting interim ex-parte injunction did not record reasons thereof or did not require the applicant to perform the duties enumerated in clauses (a) and (b) of Rule 3 of Order 39, such an order can be deemed to contain such requirements at least by implication even if they are not stated in so many words.31. EX-PARTE INTERIM INJUNCTION. Order 39 Rule 3-A. Rule 3-A does not say that the period of the injunction order should be restricted by the Court to thirty days at the first instance, but the Court should pass final order on it within thirty days from the day on which the injunction was granted. Hence, the order does not ipso facto become illegal merely because it was not restricted to a period of thirty days or less.32. 1. A. I. R. 1965 Mys. 310.. 2. A. I. R. 1965 Mys. 310.. 3. A. I.

The plaintiff has made a false and forged thumb impression of the defendant on the aforesaid agreement-deed which is dated \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 The thumb impressions on the said deed of agreement are not the thumb impressions of the defendant but of some other person who might have connived with the plaintiff along with the witnesses thereto. Moreover the plaintiff has expressly defamed the defendant by calling her a cunning lady in the plaint.. 2. That the plaintiff has not so far paid proper court fees on the plaint and has gone in revision before the learned District Judge, simply to harass the defendant and to delay the disposal of the suit and to bring the defendant, an old lady to natural death in gross abuse of the process of law.. 3. That the defendant wants to dispose of the property in suit for the proper settlement of the consideration between her legal heirs and successors and for the maintenance of herself, and it is expedient in the interest of justice that the defendant may be allowed to transfer the property in suit pendentelite subject to the conditions as this Hon\u2019ble Court may deem fit to impose.. 4. That the defendant undertakes that she will put an express condition in the transfer deed to the willing transferee, binding such transferee to abide by the decree and orders of this Hon\u2019ble Court in the suit and to disclaim all rights and title thereto on the final decree of this Court if it goes against the defendant and the willing transferee.. 5. That in the circumstances aforesaid it is further expedient that this Hon\u2019ble Court may be pleased to make a variation in the interim injunction dated\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. allowing the defendant to transfer the property in suit to some willing transferee or transferees subject to the conditions as this Hon\u2019ble Court may deem fit.. PRAYER. It is therefore most respectfully prayed that this Hon\u2019ble Court may be pleased to discharge the interim injunction or to make a variation in the interim injunction dated\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. allowing the defendant to transfer the property in suit by sale to any willing persons purchasers subject to the conditions as this Hon\u2019ble Court may deem fit in the circumstances of the case..

DEPONENT.. UNDUE HARDSHIP CAN BE GROUND FOR VARIATION OF ORDER FOR INJUNCTION. Undue hardship can be a ground for variation of an order for injunction under Order 39 Rule 4 of the Civil Procedure Code.1. ARREST BEFORE JUDGEMENT OF DEFENDANT. Order 38, Rule 1. An order of arrest before judgement of defendant is to be passed only where the plaintiff is able to make out a prima facie case and on being satisfied of the ingredients with regard to possible abscondance or disposal of the properties with intent to delay or obstruct the execution of the prospective decree. Merely because the defendant appears before the Court the relief to the plaintiff cannot be denied.2. ORDER PASSED UNDER ORDER 38 RULE 1 CPC NOT APPEALABLE. It is evident from Rule 1(2) of Order 43 that an order passed under Order 38, Rule 1 is not appealable in nature though an order under Rule 2 which is to be passed after the defendant is brought before the Court and where he fails to furnish security is appealable.3. 1.

Order 37 Rule 3. PRINCIPLES FOR GRANTING LEAVE. While giving leave to defend the suit the Court shall observe the following principles:. (a) If the Court is of opinion that the case raises a triable issue then leave to defend should ordinarily be granted unconditionally. The question whether the defence raises a triable issue or not has to be ascertained by the Court from the pleadings before it and the affidavits of parties.. (b) If the Court is satisfied that the facts disclosed by the defendant do not indicate that he has a substantial defence to raise or that the defence intended to put by the defendant is frivolous or vexatious it may refuse leave to defend altogether.. (c) In cases where the Court entertains a genuine doubt on the question as to whether the defence is genuine or sham or whether it raises a triable issue or not, the Court may impose conditions in granting leave to defend. The Court would be justified in coming to the conclusion that the issue is not a triable issue when the defence is plausible but is improbable and in such cases it can put the defendant on terms while granting leave to defend.. (d) In cases where the defendant admits that a part of the amount claimed by the plaintiff is due from him the Court shall not grant leave to defend the suit unless the amount so admitted to be due is deposited by the defendant in Court.. (e) The Court while granting leave to defend must take care to see that the object of the Rule to assist the expeditious disposal of criminal cases to which the order applies is not defeated.. (f) The Court should further take care to see that real and genuine triable issues are not shot out by unduly severe orders as to deposit1.. 1. Fateh Lal v. Sunder Lal, A. I. R. 1980 Raj. 220: 1980 W. L. N. 188.. The following principles, in respect of the grant of leave to defendant, on the basis of present provision of O. 37 of the Code, emerge:. (1) It is discretionary with the Court either to refuse or to grant leave to defend unconditionally or upon such terms as may appear to the Court to be just. But the aforesaid exercise of the discretion should be judicial and not arbitrary and whimsical.. (2) In case the defence intended to be put up if frivolous or vexatious, leave to defend must be refused.. (3) An unconditional leave to defend must be given if the facts disclosed by the defendant indicate that he has a substantial defence to raise, which means that defence so raised has good chance of success or has good potentiality to dislodge the plaintiff or which is bona fide and honest one and raises such question of law or of facts which require through judicial scrutiny.. (4) If the facts set up by the defendant do not disclose- a substantial defence, leave should normally be refused or else on account of mercy as provided for in the Supreme Court Judgment (A. I. R. 1977 S. C. 577) or due to a desire to exclude even remote chance of injustice to the defendant, leave to defend may be granted subject to the condition of deposit of amount claimed by the plaintiff or furnishing a security in respect of that amount or deposit of part of that amount and furnishing security for the payment of balance.. (5) Where a part of the amount claimed by the plaintiff is admitted by the defendant to be due from him, leave to defend the suit shall not be granted unless the amount so admitted to be due is deposited by the defendant in Court2.. EX-PARTE DECREE WITHOUT FOLLOWING PROCEDURE NOT VALID.. On the scheme of Rule 3 fulfilment of the two obligations by the defendant are intended to facilitate the plaintiff in applying for a summary judgment under sub-rule (4) but exercise of such right by the plaintiff is not entirely dependant thereon. Hence on the context and on the scheme of Rule 3 it cannot be said that the Legislature intended fulfilment of those obligations by the defendant to be a part of his act of appearance. Accordingly when a decree was passed without following sub-rules (4), (5) and (6) of Rule 3, it was held to be not valid3.. 2. Har Prasad & Co. Ltd. v. Allahabad Bank, A. I. R. 1983 Delhi 280 (283).. 3. Subir Kumar v. Mh. Habibur Riswas, A. I. R. 1980 Cal. 364.. WHEN APPEARANCE BY DEFENDANT IS SUFFICIENT. There is no particular form prescribed for entering appearance under Order 37, Rule 3. Where in a suit to which Order 37 applies the defendant filed an application purporting to be under Section 21 of the Code challenging the jurisdiction of the Court, but made no assertion in the application that to avoid ex-parte decree he is putting his appearance, the requirement of Order 37, Rule 3, as regarding entering of appearance by the defendant was complied with4.. WHEN LEAVE TO DEFEND SHOULD BE GRANTED \u2014 ILLUSTRATION.. Where the cheque was dishonoured as the owner did not have sufficient funds in the bank and that is why the endorsement on the memo by the Bank was \u201cReferred to drawer\u201d. Nevertheless, the defence being put forth that the amount of the cheque was on account and the writing of July 15, 1978 proved that fact, may seem to illusory but the defendant in the circumstances ought to be enabled to prove it. Accordingly leave was granted to the defendant to appear and defend the suit on condition of furnishing a bank guarantee for Rs. 3000/- in the trial court within a month5.. NON-MAINTAINABILITY OF APPLICATION FOR CONDONATION OF DELAY WITHOUT ENTERING APPEARANCE.. Under Order 37, Rule 3 (7) if sufficient cause is shown for non-appearance or in applying for leave to defend the suit, the delay may be excused, but until the defendant enters appearance the court obviously cannot excuse any delay and no time can be given to them for appearance6.. RECORDING REASONS FOR ORDER: NECESSITY.. While making an order under this Rule, refusing leave to defend the suit or granting the leave subject to conditions the trial court should record the reasons for making the said order7.. Order 37, Rule 2, Institution of Summary Suits. HIGH COURT\u2019S EXPRESSING OPINION ON A QUESTION OF FACT EVEN BEFORE EVIDENCE WAS LED BY PARTIES IN THE SUIT \u2014 IMPROPRIETY OF \u2014 DEFENCE PREJUDICED THEREBY.. O. 37 R. 2 and 3, S. 115. The Supreme Court has repeatedly laid down the well established principles. 4. Haryana Brewaries Ltd. v. Aluminium Manufacturing Co. Ltd., A. I. R. 1980 Delhi 311.. 5. Inderjit Sahdeo v. Ram Singh, A. I. R. 1980 Delhi 97: 1980 Rajdhani L. R. 410.. 6. Haryana Brewaries Ltd. v. Aluminium Manufacturing Co. Ltd., A. I. R. 1980 Delhi 311.. 7. Fateh Lal v. Sunder Lal, A. I. R. 1980 Raj. 220: 1980 W. L. N. 188.. which govern jurisdiction of the High Court under Section 115 C. P. C. These principles were ignored by the High Court in interfering with the discretionary order after a very detailed discussion of the facts of the case, differing on a pure question, of fact \u2014 whether the defences could be honest and bonafide. . Any decision on such a question even before evidence has been led by the two sides, is generally hazardous. It is not fair to pronounce a categorical opinion on such a matter before the evidence of the parties is taken so that its effects could be examined. In the instant case, the defendant had denied, inter alia, liability to pay anything to the plaintiff for an alleged supply of goods. . It is only in cases where the defence is patently dishonest or so unreasonable that it could not reasonably be expected to succeed that the exercise of discretion by the trial court to grant leave unconditionally may be questioned. There is no such ground of interference covered by Section 115 C. P. C.8. SUMMARY SUIT UNDER ORDR 37, C. P. C. FOR RECOVERY OF AMOUNT. The cheques were dishonoured in Delhi and more so the demand draft was made payable at Delhi. A part of cause of action having arisen at Delhi, the Delhi courts have the jurisdiction.9. In the present case, it is not clear whether the document is an indemnity or a guarantee. In any case there is no unconditional bank-guarantee. Hence leave to defend should have been granted in a summary trial suit under Order 37,CPC 1908.10. 8. M/s. Mechelec Engineers & Manufacturers v. M/s. Basic Equipment Corporation, (1976) 4 S.. C.

It is accordingly prayed.. Plaintiff. Through Advocate. Place. Dated:. CASE LAW. ORDER 34, RULE 1, PARTIES TO SUITS FOR FORECLOSURE, SALE AND REDEMPTION.. WHEN GUARANTOR MAY BE PROCEEDED AGAINST \u2014 GUIDANCE FOR.. The decree in execution is a comprehensive decree, personally against the defendants including the respondent and also against the mortgaged property. Since. a portion of the decreed amount is covered by the mortgage, the decree-holder has to proceed against the mortgaged property first and then proceed against the guarantor.. But where the decree-holder had proceeded against the mortgaged property and also against the principal debtor, execution against the guarantor is maintainable1.. APPLICATION FOR REDEMPTION FILED WITHIN LIMITATION PERIOD \u2014 INTIMATION OF \u2014 ISSUED THROUGH POST \u2014 POSTMAN REPORTED OF NOT FINDING HIM IN THE VILLAGE \u2014 DISMISSAL IN DEFAULT \u2014 ON THIS POSTAL REPORT \u2014 IMPROPER.. Where the appellant had made an application for redemption within limitation period. But the postman reported as to the information issued to him through post that he was not found in the village, and the application for redemption was dismissed on this postal report. Held that the application for redemption would be within time in this view of the matter on disregarding the illegal order of dismissal for default. The application for redemption was directed to be taken on file for being disposed of in accordance with law treating the same as within time2.. OUTER LIMIT FOR USUFRUCTURY MORTGAGE.. Order 34 Rules 7 and 8. The order limit for an usufructuary mortgagor for making payment of the amount due under the preliminary decree is passing of the final decree or the date of confirmation of the sale3.. SCOPE OF THE RULE.. A proceeding is a prescribed course of action for the enforcement of a legal right, e. g., the right of the plaintiff to apply for a final decree. Such right was to be enforced by the making of an application as prescribed by Rule 5 (3) of Order 34, when the High Court by its order stayed all further proceedings in the suit, the effect of it was that the action that would be taken for the passing of a final decree was also stayed. In other words, the filing of an application for a final decree, the court cannot entertain such an application4.. APPLICABILITY OF THE RULE. Order XXXIV, Rule 5 Civil Procedure Code is applicable and not the general provision of Section 148 for the jurisdiction for extention of time for deposit of the price of redemption5.. NECESSITY FOR FINAL DECREE.. In a case where only a money decree has been passed initially a final decree under this rule is not necessary although the decretal amount by sale of the judgment-debtor\u2019s property. Where however the property is charged without payment of the decreetal amount, the proper mode of realising the decreetal amount is to obtain a decree absolute for sale6.. COMPETENCY OF COURT.. In a mortgage suit the Court by virtue of the provisions contained in order 34 Rule 5(3), Code of Civil Procedure is competent while passing a final decree to direct that the mortgaged property or a sufficient part thereof be sold7.. COURT\u2019S OBLIGATION UNDER THE RULE. The Court is bound to set aside the sale under this Rule if the payment has been made before confirmation8.. SCOPE OF THE RULE. A suit relating to a mortgage should not be dismissed by reason of non-joinder of parties unless the parties are necessary parties and non-joinder affects the merits of the case. If the parties are merely proper parties, as distinguished from necessary parties, the Court may, though the plaintiff refuses to add them as parties, proceed under O. 1 R. 9 to deal with the matter in controversy so far as regards the rights and interests of the parties before it9.. SCOPE OF SUIT FOR REDEMPTION. In a suit for redemption of a mortgage the question of paramount title to the mortgaged property cannot be gone into10.. 1. Union bank of India v.

Where the appeal against a joint decree abates against the respondents due to failure to bring the legal representatives on record, then the appeal abates as a whole1.. WHEN APPEAL ABATES AS A WHOLE FOR NOT BRINGING LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES OF KARTA ON RECORD.. Where the decree was a money decree and a joint decree and the shares also. 1. Bhanwari Lal v. Bhulibai, A. I. R. 1972 Raj. 203.. were undefined and indivisible, failure to bring the legal representatives of the Karta on record would abate the appeal as a whole2.. INVOKING POWER OF COURT: CONDITIONS.. It is not necessary for provoking power of exemption conferred by sub-rule (4) to move an application within 90 days. Even an application for the said purpose is not required and the Court can by looking into the record itself grant the exemption. The power conferred is on the court, and writing of the same is not a condition precedent for its exercise3.. POSITION WHEN SOME LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES ALREADY ON RECORD.. If there are several legal representatives, it is sufficient if at least one of them is impleaded under this Rule. A bonafide application within time made for substitution of some of the heirs only is sufficient to keep the suit alive, there is no reason why the same principle should not hold good in a case where some of the heirs are already on record4.. ABATEMENT AGAINST SOME RESPONDENTS.. This Rule does not provide for the abatement of appeal against corespondents of deceased respondent when the legal representatives are not impleaded. It abates against them in certain circumstances, when it cannot proceed and has to be dismissed. Such result depends on the nature of the relief5.. EFFECT OF DEATH OF ONE JOINT TORT-FEASORS.. Law is settled that non-substitution of one joint tort-feasor who upon death has left behind legal representatives would lead to the inevitable dismissal of the entire litigation as it would cease to be competent6.. WHEN APPEAL DOES NOT ABATE.. Where the heir of surety was contesting his liability to satisfy the decretal debt, the appellant claimed no relief against the proforma respondent judgment debtor, by the death of proforma respondent judgment-debtor, right to sue does not revive against him or his heirs and their presence is unnecessary and appeal can proceed in their absence7.. 2.

FAILURE TO BRING LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES OF DECEASED RESPONDENT\u2014WHETHER ABATES A WRIT PETITION ? \u2014(YES).. Where in a petition for issuing a certiorari a deceased person was arrayed as one of the respondents, and his legal representatives were not brought on record, though an application had been made for impleading the legal representatives, the fact remains whatever be the person, no order had been made or the application and they were not brought on record as respondents to the petition the writ petition fails on the short ground that the persons who are necessary parties, had not been impleaded as respondents8.. NO ABATEMENT ON DEATH OF PROFORMA RESPONDENT.. Where a proforma respondent died pending appeal, who claimed no right in property in dispute, the appeal will not abate for not substituting his heirs9.. DEATH OF ONE DEFENDANT \u2014 WHEN TRIAL CAN PROCEED AGAINST REMAINING DEFENDANTS EVEN ON NON-IMPLEADMENT OF LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES.. Where in a suit for ejectment of several trespassers/defendants the interest of the defendants in the suit cannot be said to be joint and indivisible, one defendant dies and his legal representatives not brought on record, the suit can proceed against the remaining defendants. The suit stands abated against the deceased defendant only10.. WHEN APPLICATION UNDER THIS RULE NOT REQUIRED.. Where the suit was lying stayed and there was no necessity to file any application before revival of suit, there is no question of the condonation of delay in filing the application under this Rule\u201d.. SUIT FOR RECOVERY OF MONEY.. If it is a personal contract or individual contract & if sole defendant dies & nothing comes to the hands of inter-meddlers, such inter-meddlers are not liable to be substituted as right to sue does not survive in view of Order XXII Rule 4 C. P. C.12. JUDGMENT OF TRIAL COURT REVERSED IN FIRST APPEAL.. Order 22.

LIMITATION FOR PROCEEDINGS UNDER THE RULE. Article 167 of the Limitation Act gives a right to the decree-holder to initiate proceedings under this Rule within 30 days from the date of resistance. The law does not contemplate removal of cause of action or extention of limitation for initiating a proceeding under this Rule merely by putting second or any number of subsequent applications being resisted every time by the same person and initiating a proceeding within 30 days of the second or the last resistance1.. LIMITATION IN CASE OF TWO SUCCESSIVE OBSTRUCTIONS.. What Article 129 of the Limitation Act of 1983 does is to bar the making of an application about the resistance or obstruction which was made more than 30 days ago. If a second obstruction is made, the complaint is not about the first obstruction but is about the second obstruction and since the law allows the decree-holder to make such an application, it cannot be said that the provisions of Article 129 are made nugatory2.. WHAT SHOULD BE STARTING POINT OF LIMITATION.. Each obstruction made in execution of warrant for delivery of possession provides a fresh cause of action for filing an application under this Rule3.. APPLICABILITY OF THE RULE. What is required to be shown in order to maintain an obstruction to delivery of property is really possession of the person so obstructing. But proof of such possession would be of no avail unless it is further established that possession was not obtained from or under the judgment-debtor, for if it be otherwise, it would naturally be subject to the result of the suit. Any transaction during pendency of the suit would be hit by the rule of his pendens and therefore possession of person obstructing, based upon his coming into possession pendente lite, would of course be not sufficient. That is why what has to be shown is independent possession4.. If an order is passed by an executing Court after 1st February 1977 disposing of an application under this Rule which was pending on that date, the order passed by the executing Court is appealable under the provisions of the amended Code and the aggrieved party has no right to file a suit under the provisions of the Code as it stood before the amendment5.. APPEAL AGAINST ORDER. Order under Rule 97 in accordance with Rule 98 is only appealable, and revision is not competent6.. NON-MAINTAINABILITY OF OBJECTION BY MINOR SON OF JUDGMENT-DEBTOR.. Where the suit for eviction had been decreed and the decree became final, the objection filed by a minor son of the judgment-debtor before execution of the decree would not be maintainable7.. EXECUTION PROCEEDINGS. Order 21 Rule 97. The suit in respect of same subject matter of property filed after intimation of execution proceedings by appellant who is not a party to the decree is not maintainable.8. RECORDING OF COMPROMISE. The order dismissing the execution petition as withdrawn cannot be taken as recording of the compromise by the executing court.9. 1. Smt. Madora Bibi v. Mohd Mateen, A. I.

Applicant. Through Advocate. Dated:\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026... case law. Order 22 Rule 3. WHEN REFUSING SUBSTITUTION NOT PROPER. Where the delay in making substitution application was of few days only and there was satisfactory explanation for delay in seeking substitution, the High. Court was held to be in error in refusing substitution in the second appealbefore it\u2019.. WHO MAY FILE APPLICATION UNDER THIS RULE.. The words employed in this Rule, namely \u201con an application made in this behalf \u201d clearly point out that any person may file such an application. Thus a person who purports to be a legal representative of the deceased plaintiff or appellant may file an application for bringing on record the legal representatives of the deceased plaintiff or appellant, although he may be found not to be real legal representatives of the deceased plaintiff, and even then the names of the real representatives of deceased plaintiff may be brought on record if their names have been brought to the notice of the court2.. CONSENT DECREE BASED ON ONE VIEW OUT OF TWO POSSIBLE VIEWS NOT LIABLE TO CHALLENGE.. Where a compromise decree was passed in appeal, the deed creating religious trust could be constructed to have two views but the compromise was based on one view, it could not be challenged in the subsequent suit on the ground of collusion and fraud3.. CONTINUITY OF SUIT ON BASIS OF ORIGINAL SUIT.. When during the pendency of a suit the plaintiff dies, and his legal heirs are substituted, they are entitled to continue the suit on the basis of the claim laid by the original plaintiff. They are not entitled to claim independent title of theirs contrary to what has been claimed in the suit4.. DISMISSAL OF APPLICATION UNDER THIS RULE ON GROUND OF INSUFFICIENT STAMP ON GENERAL POWER OF ATTORNEY \u2014 WHETHER JUSTIFIED? \u2014 (NO). Wherein an arbitration proceeding, an application of legal representatives of a deceased party was dismissed on the ground of insufficient stamps on the deed. Held that the document ought to have been admitted in evidence on payment of stamp duty and penalty. The dismissal of the application was unjustified5.. APPLICABILITY OF THE RULE TO WRIT PETITIONS.. Though the elaborate and technical rules of the Code may not apply to applications under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, on the strength of section 141 of the Code yet the principles in general as laid down in the Code would be applicable on the grounds of justice, equity and good conscience in the matter of impleading the legal representatives6.. EFFECT OF BONA FIDE MISTAKE IN NOT SUBSTITUTING ALL HEIRS.. In a case of death of a party to a suit or appeal, even if any heir of the deceased is left out of the record and the plaintiff or appellant does not bring him on record in the bona fide belief that others being on record the only heirs, the competence of the suit or appeal will not be effected. It is immaterial whether no steps have been taken within the time allowed7.. WHEN APPEAL ABATES AS A WHOLE. When two of the plaintiff appellants died, the decree of the District Judge became final qua them. If thereafter the High Court granted a decree to the other plaintiffs appellants there would be two contradictory decisions with regard to the right which had been jointly claimed by the plaintiffs. In such a case the second appeal before a single Judge had abated as a whole and the order made by the Judge must be set aside because he could not have heard the appeal and allowed after it had abated8.. 1.

That the decree-holder has not certified the payment made to him by the applicant in this Hon\u2019ble Court so far.. PRAYER. It is therefore most respectfully prayed that this Hon\u2019ble Court may be pleased to issue notice to the decree holder to show cause as to why the payment should not be recorded as certified.. It is accordingly prayed.. Applicant. Through Advocate. Place:\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. Dated:\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. CASE LAW. Order 21 Rule 2. CERTIFICATION FOR ADJUSTMENT \u2014 CONDITIONS FOR.. The rule is well-established that there can be no certification of an adjustment between the decree-holder and the judgment-debtor O. 21, R. 2 after an auction sale is held in a case where a third party\u2019s interest intervenes. In such a case, the Court has no alternative but to confirm the sale under Order 21, Rule 92 of the Code1. . The Judicial Committee or the Privy Council in dealing with Order 21, Rule 2 held that an adjustment between the decree-holder and the judgment-debtor come at any time before the commission of an execution sale cannot nullify the decree by taking away the very foundation of the Court\u2019s power to execute the decree, viz., the existence of a decree capable of execution1a.. SCOPE OF THE RULE. If an auction sale is to be disregarded the adjustment or full satisfaction of the decree must be made under O. 21, R. 2 before the sale. In such a case the sale is altogether void and without jurisdiction and need not, therefore, be set aside and there is no scope for making an application for setting aside the sale2.. APPLICABILITY OF THE RULE.. The law is clear that this Rule applies to adjustment of a money decree as well and the executing Court is bound to execute the decree even if the decree had been satisfied fully out of Court, unless the action had been certified or recorded by the executing Court in the manner provided by the Rule-3.. CONDITIONS FOR APPLICABILITY OF THE RULE.. Before the provisions of this Rule can apply, the decree must be a money decree in one form or another. Where the decree is for possession, injunction, etc., pure and simple without there being any direction for payment of money in any shape or form, the provisions of this Rule will have no application4.. 1.

WARRANTS OF RESTORATION OF POSSESSION.. Order 21, Rule 32. Warrants of restoration of possession can be issued in favour of decree holder under Order 21 Rule 32 CPC.5. MEANING OF \u2018ADJUSTMENT\u2019.. An agreement between decree-holder and judgment-debtor to divide the disputed property and exercise full ownership over the part which was set apart to their respective shares, amounts to adjustment of the decree notwithstanding the executory character of the contract6.. APPROPRIATION OF DEPOSIT OF DECREETAL AMOUNT.. When the amounts paid by the debtor would be carrying counter interest, a certain portion of the decreetal amount relating to costs and current interest would not be carrying any interest at all. In order to avoid an incorrect result, the proper method that should be adopted is to appropriate the payments made by the judgment debtor first towards costs and interest payable under the decree and if any balance remains after such appropriation towards discharge of the principal amount7.. LIMITATION FOR PAYMENT OUT OF COURT AND CERTIFICATION BY DECREE-HOLDER.. There is no period of limitation prescribed for a certification by the decree-holder. No particular form of certification has been prescribed. A statement as to payment or adjustment made in column 5 of an execution application is, therefore, a proper certification and the execution Court is not precluded from recognising it under this Rule. The adjustment effected between the parties must be regarded as having been certified by the decree-holder and the Court executing the decree is not barred from recognising it8.. EXECUTION PETITION \u2014 CIVIL COURT CANNOT REFER MATTER OF IMPLEMENTATION OF DECREE TO POLICE DURING PENDENCY. Order 21 Rule 32. In an execution petition under Order 21 which is pending before the Executive. 5. Nanda v. Ram Dhan, 2001 (2) CCC 330 (P&H).. 6. P. Kunhi Kanan Nair v. N. Krishan, A. I. R. 1972 Ker. 90.. 7. L. I.

Court, at no point of time the Civil Courts can refer the matter of implementation of the decree, to the police. 9. WARRANTS OF RESTORATION OF POSSESSION.. Order 21, Rule 32.

It is accordingly prayed.. Applicant. Through. Advocate. Place:\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026... Dated:\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026... Affidavit in support of the application to be filed.. CASE LAW. Order 9, Rule 9.. WHETHER AN ELECTION PETITION CAN BE RESTORED? \u2014(YES) \u2014 WHO CAN FILE PETITION FOR RESTORATION OF AN ELECTION PETITION \u2014 (THE PETITIONER HIMSELF AND NOT ANYBODY ELSE).. Order 9 Rule 9 of the Code (and not Rule 13) relied by the appellant, would be the relevant provision for restoration of an election petition. That can be invoked in an appropriate case by the election petitioner only and not by a respondent. By its own language, Rule 9 provides that where a suit is wholly or partly dismissed under Rule 8, the plaintiff shall be precluded from bringing a fresh suit but he may apply for an order to set the dismissal aside. Under this rule, therefore, an application for restoration can be made by the petitioner. Since it is a provision for restoration, . it is logical that the provision should be applicable only when the party on account of whose default in appearance the petition was dismissed, makes an application to revive the petition to its former stage prior to its dismissal. In the instant case the election petitioner and not the respondent 19 who is in appeal before us, could have asked for the relief of restoration. The appellant contended that the statutory scheme authorises an elector at whose instance an election petition could have been filed to get substituted in the event of withdrawal or abatement and applying that analogy, . he urged that a petition for restoration would also lies at the instance of a respondent. The ambit of the provisions relating to withdrawal and abatement cannot be extended to meet other situations. Specific provisions have been made in the Act to deal with the two situations of withdrawal and abatement and a person neither to not a party or one of the respondents who was entitled to file an election petition has been permitted to substitute himself in the election petition and to pursue the same in accordance with law..  These provisions cannot be extended to an application under Order 9, Rule 9 of the Code and at the instance of a respondent or any other elector a dismissed petition cannot be restored1.. BAR UNDER THE RULE AGAINST LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES.. We are however not impressed by the argument that the ban imposed by Order 9, Rule 9 creates merely a personal bar or estoppel against the particular plaintiff suing on the same cause of action and leaves the matter at large for those claiming under him. Beyond the absence in Order 9, Rule 9 of the words referring \u201cto those claiming under the plaintiff there is nothing to warrant this argument. . It has neither principle, nor logic to commend it\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. The rule would obviously have no value and the bar imposed by it would be rendered meaningless if the plaintiff whose suit was dismissed for default had only to transfer the property to another and the latter was able to agitate rights which his vendor was precluded by law from putting forward.. In the instant case it was appellant who brought the previous suit which resulted in a decree for eviction of the tenant on July 31, 1961 a date when respondent 1 had already taken possession of the premises by virtue of the transfer made by the Official Liquidator. Thus the identity of the subject-matter being substantially the same, thus case clearly falls within the ambit of the ratio in the case supra. On this ground alone therefore the appellant is entitled to succeed because the High Court with due respect does not appeal to have construed the scope of Order 9, rule 9, C. P. C. properly2.. SCOPE OF THE RULE.. It is inherent in the constitution of the Court that it may own its mistake and rescind an illegal order which may not be having any sanction of law. The Court can do that as soon as it becomes obvious to it that it passed the order on an erroneous view of law when it was not conscious of the true scope of its own jurisdiction3.. An application under 0. 9, R. 9 in a proceeding in a Court of Civil jurisdiction, there is no reason why the procedure provided in regard to suits cannot be made applicable to a proceeding under this Rule. There is no justification to read any such restrictive words in Section 141. The expression \u201call proceedings\u201d is of a very wide connotation and to restrict it to a proceeding which is original in nature and wholly independent of a suit will be doing violence to the language of the section4.. It is true that under O. 9, Rule 9, if the first suit has been dismissed either wholly or partly under Rule 8, the plaintiff would not be permitted for bringing a fresh suit on the same cause of action. He is however entitled to make an application for an order to set aside the dismissal in default of the first suit5.. SCOPE OF ENQUIRY UNDER THE RULE. The scope of enquiry in an application under this Rule is confined to questions regarding the service of summons and whether there was any sufficient cause preventing the appearance of the defendant, when the suit was called on for hearing6.. APPLICABILITY TO PAUPER APPLICATION.. The provisions of Order 9 apply to pauper applications by virtue of Section 141 and a pauper application dismissed for default of appearance of the petitioner can be restored under this Rule7.. CONDITION PRECEDENT FOR PASSING ORDER UNDER THIS RULE.. In case the Court makes a finding that sufficient cause has not been made out, then only the Court would be in a position to dismiss an application but until that finding is arrived at and if on the contrary there was sufficient cause for non-appearance, the Court would be bound to make an order setting aside the dismissal. In such circumstances there is no question of exercising any option or discretion in the matter8.. NON\u2014APPLICABILITY OF THE RULE.. The Rule does not apply to applications for probate or letters of Administration9.. A judgment in probate proceedings operates as a judgment in rem unlike a judgment in an ordinary suit which operates inter-parties and hence it will not be appropriate to apply the provisions of this Order which are intended to apply to ordinary suits to applications for probate or letters of administration10.. NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MAJOR AND MINOR.. When a suit is dismissed for default whether the plaintiff is a major or minor, that dismissal can be set aside only on sufficient ground being shown\u201d.. When a suit is restored after it was dismissed on ground that neither plaintiff nor defendant has appeared on date fixed, defendant is entitled both in equity and has all right to notice of the date fixed for hearing of the case after its restoration12.. Once the court post the case for judgment, there can be no application to recall or advance the hearing for any purpose other than pronouncement of judgment13.. SUIT FOR RECOVERY OF MONEY.. The document writer cannot be treated as an attesting witness for the will to prove its execution14.. 1. Dr. P. NallaThampy Thera v. B. L. Shankar and others. (1984) Supp. S. C. C. 631: A. I.

That the defendant\u2019s submit that in the entire plaint not even one word has been stated that the plaintiff is the owner of the disputed area.

Section 53 B of Delhi Development Act provides as under:. \u201c(i) No suit shall be instituted against the Authority, or any member thereof, or any of its Officers or other employees, or any person acting under the directions of the Authority or any member or any Officer or other Employees of the Authority in respect of any Act done or purporting to have been done in pursuance of this Act or any rule or regulation made thereunder until the expiration of two months after notice in writing has been, in the case of the Authority, . left at its Office, and in any other case, delivered to, or left at the office or place of abode of, the person to be sued and unless such notice states explicitly the cause of action, the nature of relief sought, the amount of compensation claimed and the name and place of residence of the intending plaintiff and unless the plaint contains a statement that such notice has been so left or delivered.. (ii) No Suit such as is described in sub-section (1) shall, unless it is a suit for recovery of immovable property or for a declaration of title thereto, be instituted after the expiry of six months from the date on which the cause of action arises.. (iii) Nothing contained in sub-section (1) shall be deemed to apply to a suit in which the only relief claimed is an injunction of which the object would be defeated by the giving of the notice or the postponement of the institution of the suit. \u201c. 4. That similarly Section 478 of Delhi Municipal Corporation Act provides as under:. \u201c1. No suit shall be instituted against the Corporation or against any Municipal Authority or against any municipal officer or other municipal employee or against any person acting under the order or direction of any municipal authority or any municipal officer or other municipal employee, in respect of any act done, or purported to have been done, in pursuance of this Act or any rule, regulation or bylaw made thereunder, until the expiration of two months after notice in writing has been left at the Municipal Office and, in the case such Officer, . employee or person, unless notice in writing has also been delivered to him or left at his office or place of residence, and unless such notice states explicitly the cause of action, the nature of the relief sought, the amount of compensation claimed, and the name and place of residence of the intending plaintiff, and unless the plaint contains a statement that such notice has been so left or delivered.. 2. No suit, such as described in sub-section (1), shall unless it is a suit for the recovery of immovable property or for a declaration of title thereto be instituted after the expiry of six months from the date on which the cause of action arise.. 3. Nothing in sub-section (1) shall be deemed to apply to a suit in which the only relief claimed is an injunction of which the object would be defeated by the giving of the notice or the postponement of the institution of the suit.\u2019\u2019. Thus from the aforesaid provisions it will be evident that no suit except for the relief of injunction can be instituted against the Delhi Development Authority and Municipal Corporation of Delhi. It will further be seen that the provisions of the aforesaid Acts are same. . The defendants 3 & 4 submit that it is a mandatory requirement of law that no suit shall be instituted against the Delhi Development Authority and Municipal Corporation of Delhi until the expiration of two months after notice in writing has been given and unless such notice states explicitly the cause of action, the nature of relief sought unless the plaint contains a statement that such notice has been so left or delivered.. 5. That the defendants 3 & 4 submit that the plaint does not contain any averments to the effect that a notice under Section 53 B has been given/served upon the Delhi Development Authority defendant No. 1 and upon Municipal Corporation of Delhi, defendant No. 2, under Section 478 of Delhi Municipal Corporation Act. This being the mandatory requirements, the suit of the plaintiff is liable to be rejected under Order 7 Rule 11.. 6.

This section is introduced in the Code with the object of facilitating the exercise of rights by persons in whom they came to be vested by devolution or assignment. Whether the application for addition of party under this section is held earlier or simultaneously, the list is then pending. The only legal order that can be legitimately passed in these circumstances would be to enquire into the application of the transferee and to dispute of the compromise petition thereafter. . When after passing of decree and before filing of the appeal against it, the decree holder transfers his interest and the decree-holder, joined as a respondent dies during the pendency of the appeal, the transferee can under this section apply for substitution as a respondent in place of the person already joined as a respondent in place of the person already joined as a legal representative of the deceased decree-holder1.. There are various provisions in the Code prescribing of allowing the doing of an act for which time is fixed or granted by the Court. In all such cases the Court has powers under this Section to enlarge the time, even after expiration of the period originally fixed. The time granted by the Court for payment of costs, while setting aside an ex-pane decree, as a condition precedent, is not an act prescribed or allowed by the Code. The section does not apply to such a case. On the other hand, section 151 can however be invoked in such a case2.. 1. Prahlad Misra v. Narasingha Mahapatra, I. L. R. (1965) Cut. 523: 32 Cut. L.

Act)\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. in Criminal Revision No. \u2026\u2026\u2026. of 20\u2026\u2026.. with costs throughout and to passsuch other and further orders as it deems fit in the circumstances of the case.The present Revision is being filed inter alia on the followingGROUNDS. deliberately keeping herself absent from the Court on the dates fixed, showing the non-seriousness of the respondent to pursue the matter.. The powers of revision granted by sub-Section (1) are not to be used in respect to any interlocutory orders made in any appeal, enquiry, trial, or other procedure, according to Section 397(2) of the Cr.P.C.3. In the case of Madhu Limaye v. State of Maharashtra4, the supreme court made a ruling on the issue of the court\u2019s inherent powers. In this case, it was determined that the prohibition under Section 397(2) to consider the revision application regarding the interlocutory orders cannot be said to be a prohibition under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code because Section 482 is independent of Sections 397-401 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which grant the High Court a broad range of powers that cannot be listed in full.. It was reaffirmed in the case of Raj Kapoor v. State5 that Section 397 of the Criminal Procedure Code could not be considered to constitute a bar on Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code and that other provisions of the Cr.P.C., 1973 cannot influence the inherent powers of High Courts.. But the fundamental issue\u2014namely, whether the courts can be contacted under Section 482 while the remedies provided by Sections 397\u2013401 of the Criminal Procedure Code are available\u2014has been a judicial hot potato. Recently, the issue was decided and resolved. Dhariwal Tobacco Products Ltd. v. State of Maharashtra6 and Mohit alias Sonu v. State of Uttar Pradesh7 were two earlier decisions that disagreed on the matter.. It was determined that even if you had a remedy under Sections 397-401 of the Cr.P.C., you could still use Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. to invoke the inherent powers of the High Court. However, the Mohit v. State of U.P. ruling was the exact opposite, holding that you would not be allowed to use Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. if a remedy is available under Sections 397-401 of the Cr.P.. In Prabhu Chawla v. state of Rajasthan8, the matter was finally decided while keeping in mind the two contradicting rulings mentioned above. The three-judge panel upheld and clarified the legislation, holding that a petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. would not be barred by the availability of a remedy under the Cr.P.C..

VersusThe State of NCT, Delhi\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 RespondentCriminal Appeal Against the order dated and passed by ASJ, Delhi convicting the appellant u/s392/397/34 of IPC and sentencing to undergo RI for a period of 7 years.Most respectfully showeth: \u2013That the humble appellant was tried by Ld. Additional Session Judge, Delhi for the offence u/s392/397/34 IPC and on conviction, sentenced to undergo RI seven years, vide order dated 24-12-2001:. (A) That there was no such offence taken place at all, even if it is so, it was only &\u201cpick pocketing\u201d in terms of PCR report as referred in para 9 of the judgment \u2013 no. robbery or dacoity as charged by the court had ever taken place.(B) That knife as alleged was planted later to make the case u/s 397 IPC for thepublic nor the two scooterist never spoke about the knife, nor they were producedas witness, hence the case is cooked up, more so three persons known to thevictim (PW-3\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. ) will not attack for a mere Rs. 50/- unless they knew thatthe victim is in possession of a big amount nor they did not even tried to snatch thecycle. Case is concocted to which police got benefit and PW-3.(C) That PW-3 (star witness as claimed by prosecution) states that hishand was held by Raju accused and point knife at his throat andtool-out money. On the other hand local police states (PW-7\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 in para 10 ofjudgment) accused\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 was found possession. of a folding knife in his right pocket of his wearing. There is contradiction. The PW-3 states in his statement before court. that he was pulling cycle as his cycle was punctured, when mentioned about thisneither in his Asal Tehrir improvement in his version,besides he states back as 9/9-30 pm. before court timing is 10.15 pm. How could accused Raju take out money andknife from his pocket when PW-3 was held by the both hands of accused Raju.In his cross-examination, he did not remember anything-who took out money anddiary-but agreed to have sealed diary and Rs. 60-note (XX by App. ) Only afabricated case against innocent person could come to such contradictoryconclusion.(D) That interestingly PCR official never spoke about open knife nor folding knifewhich the accused were handed over to PCR official by public nor PCR officialspoke about open and folding knife while handing over to Local police. It is certainif the accused were beaten by public including the two scooterists and their pillionrider, they must have handed over open knife alleged to have been placed at thethroat of victim (PW-3) to police official of PCR or to local police. It is not done so,because there was no such knife nor such incident took place, it proves the case isconcocted one, otherwise question of open knife or folding knife would have cometo light.(E) That as per complainant, PW-3, it was two scooterists and their pillon rider whorescued him, besides police agreed presence of these two scooterists and largenumber of public at red-light crossing, still the prosecution did not brought tosupport truthfulness of prosecution version, then how could Ld. ADJ believe theversion and how could court can come to conclusion to the correctness of thecrime. It was absolutely one sided and wrong decision for no public witness wasbrought forwarded for deposition of correctness of the crime. Even not a singleword either spoken or referred questioning police as to why police did not havethem as witness since they (scooterists) were the first person to rescue the victim.(F) That police personnel having arrived later to the spot after civilian andscooterists took control over the accused are duty bound to supply the names ofthose persons who took control over the three accused. Prosecution/police did notdo so, hence there is doubt if at all such things/incident were happened or not?The incident took place between 9 to 9. 30 PM and police arrived after 10. 30 PM.It is unlikely that the gathered public/crowd would have stayed for one hour or thescooterists would have stayed for an hour so that they could hand over the culprit.Prosecution story seems to be fraud and not possible. Conviction based on suchirrelevant considerations need to be set aside for nosuch incident took place for no public would wait for an hour to hand over theculprit to police, if so why police did not took their names and produced aswitnesses before court.. (G) That story states that accused attempting to run away not possible for accusedwas surrounded by public, including two scooterists and beaten by public. Underthe circumstances, it is unlikely his attempt to run away from the spot. It is agreedby prosecution that accused along with other co-accused were captured by publicand handed over to the police (PCR), hence injury was not due to the process ofattempting to run away as alleged. He was dashed by possibly against hard objectlike well or beaten by blunt object on head (over right side skull). Such injury couldbe caused by such treatment and not by fall. Rather 3rd degree method to acceptthe use was employed against. (Forceful confession).(H) That there is different version between PW-3 in his Asal Tehrir, FIR and that of. statement before court. There is different version between police officials and PW-3 about knifes. That the question cycle \u201cpulling\u201d is something strange for a. punctured cycle could only be pushed forward and can not be pulled. A person canonly pull a thing towards himself in the sense if he was pulling the cycle, questionof coming forward and standing of accused person before him is impossible. Onpulling cannot a person moved backward. Hence attacking while going towardhome (moving forwards) not plausible. There is material contradiction and it isserious as the versions cuts each other. PCR who first caught accused neverspeaks about knife nor those scooterists or public assembled there, while local. police speaks about recovery of folding knife in accused pocket, complainant (PW-3) states that knife was pointed at his throat, itself a big contradiction and it seem. knife was planted to make robbery for an offence Under Section 397 IPC.Appellant entitled to be acquitted in view of 1998 (1) JCC 108, Rahees Ahmadwhere material contradiction is too material as in this case.. PRAYER.

        "The Personal Data Protection Bill (PDPB), currently under consideration in India, represents a major shift in the way data privacy is conceptualized and regulated in the country. It aims to create a robust framework to safeguard the personal data of individuals while also defining the duties of data fiduciaries. This article aims to analyze the impact of the PDPB and its implications for individual privacy and businesses in India.. To begin with, let\u2019s take a look at the implications for individual privacy. The PDPB seeks to empower individuals by giving them control over their personal data. This aligns with the global trend toward more rigorous data privacy laws, a phenomenon seen in the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California\u2019s Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). In essence, the PDPB provides a comprehensive set of rights to data principals (the individuals to whom the data pertains) \u2013 including the right to access and correct their data, the right to data portability, and, most significantly, the right to be forgotten.. The right to be forgotten, which enables individuals to erase their digital footprint, can be particularly impactful. It might influence the type of information people feel comfortable sharing online and could significantly impact how businesses interact with customers. However, there are certain limitations to this right, which could potentially lead to conflicts between public interests and individual privacy.. On the business side, the PDPB\u2019s potential impacts are substantial and multifaceted. Businesses that collect, store, and process personal data are deemed as \u2018data fiduciaries\u2019 under the bill. The PDPB imposes several obligations on these fiduciaries. For instance, they are required to process data transparently and in a fair manner, ensuring the privacy of the individual.. For businesses, especially those relying heavily on data, such as IT, e-commerce, and fintech companies, complying with the PDPB could lead to significant operational changes. They might need to overhaul their data collection and processing practices, implement new security measures, and provide detailed privacy notices to customers. These additional requirements could potentially increase the cost of business and impact profitability.. Furthermore, the PDPB introduces the concept of \u2018data localization,\u2019 requiring businesses to store a copy of all personal data within the country. This might impact multinational companies and tech giants that currently store data on global servers. Such companies may have to invest in local data storage facilities, which could result in increased costs and operational challenges.. While the PDPB is a step in the right direction, it\u2019s not without its controversies. One major point of concern revolves around the provision that allows the government to exempt any of its agencies from the law\u2019s purview, sparking fears about state surveillance and infringement of privacy.. There are also concerns about the autonomy of the proposed Data Protection Authority (DPA). Critics argue that the DPA, which is tasked with enforcing the PDPB, lacks sufficient independence from the government, raising questions about its ability to act impartially.. The PDPB presents a major milestone in India\u2019s data privacy landscape. While it seeks to protect individual privacy, it also imposes new obligations on businesses, potentially changing how they operate. As we look forward to the bill\u2019s implementation, it will be interesting to see how these changes play out in practice.. On the whole, while the PDPB has its limitations and critics, it is undeniably an important step towards establishing a robust data protection framework in India. It brings the country closer to international data protection standards and, hopefully, paves the way for a future where data privacy is not just an aspiration but a reality..
